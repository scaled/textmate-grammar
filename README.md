# Scaled TextMate Grammar

This library implements [TextMate] [language grammars] in a way that allows them to be easily used
with [Scaled] to provide syntax highlighting and any other syntax-driven functionality that a
Scaled mode might like to do.

Better documentation is forthcoming, so right now you'll just have to look at the code.
